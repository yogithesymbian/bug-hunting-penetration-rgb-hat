## Low $617 - $2,000
Low severity issues allow an attacker to access extremely limited amounts of data. They may violate an expectation for how something is intended to work but allow nearly no escalation of privilege or ability to trigger unintended behavior by an attacker. For example:

signing up arbitrary users for access to an “early access feature” without their consent
creating an issue comment that bypasses our image proxying filter by providing a malformed URL
triggering verbose or debug error pages without proof of exploitability or obtaining sensitive information
triggering application exceptions that could affect many users
injecting JavaScript event handlers into links, etc., that are mitigated by CSP on GitHub.com
disclosing the existence of private packages on npm that should be inaccessible, e.g., through error messages (but not through timing attacks, which are ineligible)
novel supply chain vulnerabilities that affect a GitHub product but are not solely limited to that product
credentials such as those from the .npmrc file or from GitHub Enterprise Server being leaked in logs
